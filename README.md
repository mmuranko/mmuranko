## Hi there 👋

I am a Master of Science in Finance student at **HEC Lausanne**, starting in 2025.  
My academic and professional interests lie at the intersection of **finance, data science, and programming**.  

This GitHub serves as my portfolio of projects, showcasing applications of **Python, data analysis, and quantitative finance**.

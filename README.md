## Hi there!

I am an MSc in Finance student at **HEC Lausanne**, specialising in asset & risk management. Before that, I studied chemistry at **ETH Zurich** (MSc) and **Heidelberg University** (BSc). I decided to change career paths to seek new, more quantitative challenges and follow my other passion outside of organic chemistry, which is (quantitative) finance.

This GitHub serves as my portfolio of projects, both private and MScF-related.
